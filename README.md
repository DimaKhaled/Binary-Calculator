# Binary-Calculator
This program is a binary calculator that performs four key operations on binary numbers: one's complement (flipping all bits), two's complement (flipping bits and adding 1, used for negative numbers), addition (bit-by-bit addition with carry-over), and subtraction (bit-by-bit subtraction with borrowing). It first validates user input to ensure only binary digits (0s and 1s) are entered. For calculations, it treats binary numbers as strings to manipulate individual bitsâ€”flipping them for complements, adding them with carry propagation for sums, or subtracting them with borrow handling for differences. The program uses a menu-driven interface where users select an operation, input their binary numbers, and receive the result. For example, two's complement is computed by first inverting all bits (one's complement) and then adding 1 to the least significant bit, while addition and subtraction mimic manual binary arithmetic, processing bits from right to left while managing carries or borrows. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.
